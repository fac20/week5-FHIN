This project was created during the 5th week of [Founders and Coders'](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) 20th cohort (a.k.a database week ğŸ˜±). 

Our aim was to **get familiar with databases** (design and document a database schema, normalize our data to reduce duplication, create a relational database, etc..) and **SQL** (SQL queries, query parameters to avoid SQL-injection vulnerabilities) as well further our knowledge of **Node** (handle database errors on our server without crashing).
