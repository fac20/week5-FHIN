This project was created during the 5th week of [Founders and Coders'](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) 20th cohort (a.k.a database week ðŸ˜±). 

Our aim was to **get familiar with databases** (design and document a database schema, normalize our data to reduce duplication, create a relational database, etc..) and **SQL** (SQL queries, query parameters to avoid SQL-injection vulnerabilities) as well further our knowledge of **Node** (handle database errors on our server without crashing).

## Schema Info

Our databse has two tables that are referencing each other on user id.

#### Users

| Column     | Type                                              | Constraints |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| id         | SERIAL (translates to integer and AUTO_INCREMENT) | PRIMARY KEY |
| username   | VARCHAR(255)                                      | NOT NULL    |
